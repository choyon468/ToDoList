# ToDoList
To-do list application with CRUD operations. The front-end is built using CSS and EJS, and the back-end is built using Node, Express and also EJS. The application manages data using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. 
# How to start it locally
1. Download all the files (including the folders) and store them in a custom folder. CD (Change Directory) over to that custom folder in your preferred editor's terminal.
2. Make sure to create a database named "permalist" and a table named "items" using pgAdmin. Then provide the data in "index.js" before connecting to the database. 
3. Run "node index.js" or if you have nodemon installed run "nodemon index.js".
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/ to access the fully functional web application.
